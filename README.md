# mplay

This is just a fake media player for an interview.
It is not actually playing any song :)

To compile:
make

It creates an executable called 'mplay'.
Run it by typing './mplay'

You then enter an interactive mode.
Just type 'help' at the prompt to get the recognized keywords and how to navigate.
